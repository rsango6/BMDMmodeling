# **Repository Description**

This repository complements the manuscript "Computational modelling reveals and predicts flux differences in nucleotide metabolism in IL-4-treated Cyp27a1-KO bone marrow-derived macrophages". It contains metabolic models, scripts, spreadsheets and a tutorial on how to perform a gene knockout of interest, as well as performing downstream processing and vizualization schemes.
